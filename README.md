*wiggly-jiggly keeps your machine "awake" by programatically moving your mouse*

# Before you start

*wiggly-jiggly* isn't designed to fool your boss/coworkers into thinking that you're working when you aren't. Trust me, they know.

# Use

*wiggly-jiggly* uses [robotgo](https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo#requirements), so you need to [install these requirements first](https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo#requirements).

Then you can clone the repository and use the normal `go run .`

# Supported OSes

*wiggly-jiggly* should support macos, windows and *nix.
